			<p>Welcome. I am Mark Swoope, a practitioner of computer programming since 2008.</p>
			<p>My preferred programming languages are C and JavaScript because they are optimized, portable, and critical. Other programming languages I know are C++, Lua, and x86 Assembly.</p>
			<p>I have chosen not to embrace any of the newer industry languages because I do not find them computationally or even syntactically superior to the existing languages they are attempting to replace.</p>
			<p>I am currently working on my own, as yet to be released, programming language which I hope will make all other languages irrelevant for me. The primary principle for this language will be <em>unconcealment of potentiality</em>: applied as the transparency of the mutability within a program's state of both information and execution. From this single principle, many of today's and yesterday's language features are destroyed from inclusion in this newer, revaluated language.</p>
