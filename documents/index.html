			<p>Welcome. I am Mark Swoope, a practitioner of computer programming since 2008.</p>
			<p>My preferred programming languages are C and JavaScript because they are optimized, portable, and critical. Other programming languages I know are C++, Lua, and x86 Assembly.</p>
			<p>I have taken interest in linear logic, type theory, and compilers. I am currently working on my own, as yet to be released, programming language.</p>
