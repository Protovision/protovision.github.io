			<h3>socketstream</h3>
			<p><a rel="external noopener" href="https://github.com/protovision/socketstream">https://github.com/protovision/socketstream</a></p>
		</header>
		<p>A C++ library that provides std::iostream derived classes for performing TCP/IP socket I/O for network communication. Supports formatted I/O and works with standard C++ stream manipulators as the classes properly derive from the standard stream and streambuf classes. Buffering is handled internally and direct I/O is performed for large unformatted data. Supports POSIX and Windows sockets. Supports C++ move semantics and maintains basic exception safety.</p>
