	The following articles have inspired me to make this article about 
	formalizing modules in a programming language:

	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The authors of those articles are big shot computer scientists with several 
	credentials. I am a nobody, mostly self-taught programming hobbyist who has 
	yet to break into any kind of white collar position, much less in tech or 
	academia.
</p>
<p>
	Here I develop my own rudimentary theory that incorporates modules into a 
	typed lambda calculus. I must first define the concept of a module: as a 
	term and as a type.
</p>
<p>
	As a term, a module exists meaningfully as a set of variables and functions.
	The type of a module's variables and functions may depend on types defined 
	within the scope of that module. 



	A typed, lambda calculus formalizes a programming language by defining the 
	rules in which typed terms can be introduced or eliminated within certain 
	contexts. For modules to be supported, we must determine how a module term 
	can be introduced/eliminated and how a module type is to be represented. 
</p>
<p>
	First, the concept of a module must be made concrete. I shall define the 
	module term as a term whose type may depend on a type whose scope is bound 
	to that term. And a module type is a type that may depend on a type whose 
	scope is bound to that type.
</p>
<p>
	That sounds abstract so an example of a module type is:
</p>
<figure>
	<pre class="no-margin shaded padded">
		let&nbsp;type&nbsp;div_t&nbsp;=&nbsp;int&nbsp;&wedge;&nbsp;int&nbsp;in&nbsp;type&nbsp;(int&nbsp;&wedge;&nbsp;int&rarr;&nbsp;div_t)
	</pre>
</figure>
<p>
	This represents the type of modules that contain a function of type 
	(int &wedge; int &rarr; div_t) where div_t is defined as (int &wedge; int) 
	for those modules.
</p>
<p>
	A term of this type could be expressed with:
</p>
<figure>
	<pre class="no-margin shaded padded">
		let&nbsp;type&nbsp;div_t&nbsp;=&nbsp;int&nbsp;&wedge;&nbsp;int&nbsp;in&nbsp;export(&lambda;x:(int&wedge;int).div_t(fst(x)/snd(x),fst(x)%snd(x)))
	</pre>
</figure>
<p>
	The export operator makes the inner lambda term usable from expressions 
	external to the scope of this module term, without which it becomes 
	encapsulated from outside use. This implies that a module type expresses 
	only what is exported from module terms that belong to that type.
</p>
<p>
	A module term may also be expressed using an <em>import</em> operator:
</p>
<figure>
	<pre class="no-margin shaded padded">
		import&nbsp;s&nbsp;:&nbsp;M
	</pre>
</figure>
<p>
	Here, M is a module type and s is a string that represents the name or path
	of an externally-defined module existing in the host system; the import 
	expression produces a new module term that implements module type M using 
	the definition of the module referenced by s.
</p>


(lambda div_t :: * . (int , int) -> div_t)(int , int)
