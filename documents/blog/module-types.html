		<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		Here, I develop my own understanding of modules and how they can be 
		represented in a typed programming language.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like many things in computer science, modules do not have a unifying 
		definition across programming languages. There is this vague idea that 
		a module is a unit of functions, data, and types and that any of these 
		components can be imported into or exported out of the containing module.
	</p>
	<p>
		I shall start with this idea and solidify it. A module existing within 
		a running program is, at the very least, a product of data and functions 
		(references to functions). In this respect, it is not different from an
		ordinary product or tuple.
	</p>
	<p>
		Programming languages usually do not allow product types to contain 
		declarations of anything other than data whose visibility is always public
		from outside terms of that product.
	</p>
	<p>
		Modules are distinguished from products because modules may contain 
		declarations of data, functions, types, and even other modules. Each member 
		can be internal to the module or exported for other modules to import.
	</p>
	<p>
		What makes a module different from an object-oriented class is unclear until
		the details of a module is clarified and compared with a particular model 
		of the class from a particular programming language.
	</p>
	<p>
		When explaining modules it must always be clear from this point on if we 
		are talking about module types or module terms. Like any other kind of term,
		a module term exists as an instance of it's assigned module type. I can 
		think of two ways a module term can be introduced: through a direct 
		definition or through an import expression.
	</p>

		<h3>2. Import expressions</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		An import expression can look like <code>import s : M</code> where 
		<code>M</code> is the module type and <code>s</code> is a string specifying
		the name or path of a module that exists somewhere in the host system. The 
		module type must be specified since the definition of the module is usually 
		unknown to the user and is never known by the compiler. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The result of an import expression is a module term or a compilation failure
		only if the string <code>s</code> is a constant expression: the import 
		expression becomes comparable to static linking. If <code>s</code> is not 
		a constant expression, then, if the language supports it, the import 
		expression becomes comparable to dynamic linking. 
	</p>
	<p>
		So the type of result of <code>import s : M</code> is <code>M</code> or 
		<code>M &vee; &bot;</code> depending on if <code>s</code> is constant. If 
		the dynamic import fails, then the actual result becomes &bot; which causes 
		program termination.
	</p>

		<h3>3. Module expressions</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		A module term has member terms publicly accessible via member access operator 
		or superscript. Each publicly accessible member term of a module term is 
		expressed in the module type which expresses only what that module has 
		exported. Module types have member types which the types of the member terms 
		of the module term may depend on, but these members types are already fully 
		defined. In a type system of nominal-equivalence, this is an important detail 
		but we shall not worry about this in this article and replace module member 
		types with their full definitions wherever they occur in the type of a module 
		member term.
	</p>
	<p>
		This means that the type of a module is nothing more than a product type, 
		composed of the types of it's exported member terms. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Aside from import, a language must allow a module term to be introduced 
		by directly defining one: this can be called a module expression. A module 
		term can be expressed as a product of terms where <em>some</em> of those 
		terms can be annotated with <code>export</code>. The type of a module 
		expression becomes the product of the types of terms that have been exported. 
		The non-exported terms are stored with the resulting module term but are 
		not exposed in the module type. Here is an example of a module term:
		<code>module (w : T = e , x : U = f , export y : V = g , export z : W = h)</code>, 
		the type of this module term is <code>(V , W)</code>.

		<h3>4. Implementation details</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		I find that my definitions of import expression and module expressions compose
		fairly well together. Module equality would be defined how product equality 
		is defined which depends on function equality for function members. 
		Function equality is undecidable if the definition of either function is 
		unknown, most languages compare the the addresses of functions for equality
		and perhaps this may be good enough for practical purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Even though module terms are used like product terms, perhaps they need to 
		be annotated to indicate if the term is the result of a static module or 
		dynamically imported module so that the implementation can resolve how to 
		actually perform member access. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A module term imported using a dynamic string can be implemented as a pair 
		of a handle and the product of data and functions of the module. The handle 
		is acquired from the linux library call <code>dlopen</code>, the product of 
		member terms is acquired from a call to <code>dlsym</code> for each exported 
		member expressed in the specified module type. When a dynamic module term is 
		eliminated, the handle must be disposed of using <code>dlclose</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Module terms that are dynamic and require cleanup must be of a linear type
		to enforce the cleanup phase. Of course none of this is a problem if 
		dynamically imported modules are not allowed by the language.

	<p>
		In these typing rules, the lexeme <em>module</em> is used as both a term 
		and type constructor. Even though module terms are used like product terms 
		(both having fst and snd operations), their type must include a module 
		qualifier so that the implementation can properly resolve member lookup.
	</p>
	<p>
		There can also be a dynamic module type whose terms are introduced from
		import expressions using non-constant-evaluated strings.
	</p>
	<p>
		One thing I did not talk about was scoping, briefly I will say that 
		function terms defined inside a module expression have an immediate 
		enclosing scope that contains the members of the module term being 
		expressed. The member function terms have access to them as if they were 
		free variables to those functions: this implies that the module is 
		now a record: a product of named members.
	</p>
	<p>
		As for initialization, the module expression is an expression of a term 
		and so the values of any member data of the module term can be expressed 
		directly. If module code needs to executed for initialization, then 
		this comes down to a matter of convention of the entry point function 
		name and whether or not that entry point function is exposed in the 
		module type (it shouldn't be exposed). A lot of other details involved 
		in module initialization and module equality depend on whether or not 
		modules can contain, depend on, or produce effects or mutable state.
		A good language will need to isolate these things.
