		<p>
			This entry is not related to type theory and is focused more on how I will
			structure my new projects, both in their file organization and code.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first aspect to the beginning of anything in a project is choosing a 
			name. I am not talking about the name of the project, I still struggle with 
			determining that, but the name of entities within the project. 
		</p>
		<p>
			There are conventional names for top-level directory files. These should be 
			kept according to convention but everything else can be of my choosing:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><kbd>README.md</kbd></li>
			<li><kbd>COPYING.md</kbd> or <kbd>LICENSE.md</kbd></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Markdown is popular enough to warrant preference over plain text files. And 
			the above files are conventional enough to keep their names as such. The 
			choice of <kbd>COPYING</kbd> over <kbd>LICENSE</kbd> indicates an alignment 
			with GNU and/or copyleft organizations. Microsoft Github, the most popular 
			software 	repository host, chooses <kbd>LICENSE</kbd> for it's users by 
			default.
		</p>
		<p>
			The GNU Coding Standards recommends a handful of additional files which I 
			deem unnecessary for my tasks. These are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<kbd>INSTALL</kbd>: Which contains <q>an explanation of the installation 
				procedure</q>. I think this description should be kept inside the 
				<kbd>README.md</kbd> file. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>NEWS</kbd>: Which contains <q>a list of user-visible changes worth 
				mentioning</q>. I think project news should be on the project website, 
				preferrably on the front page. This implies all projects should have a 
				website that supplements, in detail, the information found from the 
				referencing <kbd>README.md</kbd> file.
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>ChangeLog</kbd>: Which contains <q>all the changes made to program
				source files</q>. This is completely obsoleted by the invention of 
				version control systems such as Git. And GNU rightly acknowledges this 
				and declares this file optional. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<kbd>configure</kbd>: This file, coupled with other files such as 
				<kbd>aclocal.m4</kbd>, <kbd>configure.ac</kbd>, <kbd>config.h.in</kbd>,
				<kbd>Makefile.am</kbd>, and <kbd>Makefile.in</kbd> are part of the complex 
				and overly engineered GNU Build System (known as Autotools) which nobody 
				but GNU uses. It should be noted that a project can follow the 
				<code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code> build 
				method without depending on autotools if the programmer manually wrote 
				the <kbd>configure</kbd> script but this requires a lot of reading 
				and adherence to GNU coding standards to get right.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			My preferred build system is plain Make without the use of CMake or 
			autotools. I prefer the configuration of Make to happen in a separate 
			make file filled with variables that the user can edit and that the main 
			Makefile can subsequently include. It is simple enough and works well for 
			my purposes. This configuration file should have the following variables:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>prefix = /usr/local</code></li>
			<li><code>exec_prefix = $(prefix)</code></li>
			<li><code>bindir = $(exec_prefix)/bin</code></li>
			<li><code>datarootdir = $(prefix)/share</code></li>
			<li><code>includedir = $(prefix)/include</code></li>
			<li><code>docdir = $(datarootdir)/doc</code></li>
			<li><code>libdir = $(exec_prefix)/lib</code></li>
			<li><code>srcdir = .</code></li>
			<li><code>AR = ar</code></li>
			<li><code>CC = cc</code></li>
			<li><code>INSTALL = install</code></li>
			<li><code>INSTALL_DATA = $(INSTALL) -m 644</code></li>
			<li><code>INSTALL_PROGRAM = $(INSTALL)</code></li>
			<li><code>CFLAGS = </code></li>
			<li><code>CPPFLAGS = </code></li>
			<li><code>LDFLAGS = </code></li>
			<li><code>LDLIBS = </code></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			And the Makefile will perform it's operations in terms of these variables.
		</p>
		<p>
			Apart from conventional files with their conventional names, I choose two
			top-level directories for my project: <kbd>code</kbd> and 
			<kbd>documents</kbd>. I now prefer to avoid abbreviations and acronyms 
			when naming things; I also prefer to avoid words that have only been 
			around for less than a century, but this is sometimes impossible.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <kbd>documents</kbd> directory should contain the project's static 
			website. This website should contain all documentation of the project, 
			including:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Program manual</li>
			<li>Library manual</li>
			<li>Other manuals and references</li>
			<li>Tutorials, guides, and examples</li>
			<li>Installation instructions</li>
			<li>Source code browser from within the website (nice but optional)</li>
			<li>Prebuilt package downloads</li>
			<li>News</li>
			<li>Authors</li>
			<li>License</li>
			<li>Donations and sponsors</li>
			<li>Links to associated forums and chat networks</li>
			<li>Code of Conduct and obligatory virtue pledging allegiance pages</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The <kbd>code</kbd> directory should contain all project source code in
			the following sub-directory structure:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><kbd>interfaces</kbd>: A set of subdirectories for each library that 
			this project uses (including this project as a library), each containing 
			header files of that library. 
			<li><kbd>modules</kbd>: A set of subdirectories for each library that this 
			project uses or generates (including this project as a library), each 
			containing non-header source files of that library.</li>
			<li><kbd>programs</kbd>: A set of subdirectories for each standalone 
			exectuable program that this project uses or generates, each containing 
			non-header source files of that program.
		</ul>
		<p>
			Ultimately, program code from <kbd>code/programs/*/*.c</kbd> is compiled 
			with library code from <kbd>code/modules/*/*.c</kbd>, both of which include
			header files from the include path <kbd>code/interfaces</kbd>. Specific 
			dependencies between source and header files can be automatically resolved
			by using the <code>-M</code> and related GCC options and can somehow be 
			imported into Make.
		</p>
		<p>
			The intermediate result in the root directory is a directory called 
			<kbd>objects</kbd> which is a mirror of the <kbd>code</kbd> directory 
			(minus the <kbd>interfaces</kbd> subdirectory) with all <kbd>.c</kbd> files 
			replaced with <kbd>.o</kbd> files.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final result in the root directory are two directories: 
			<kbd>modules</kbd> which is a mirror of <kbd>objects/modules</kbd> with 
			all <kbd>.o</kbd> files replaced with <kbd>.a</kbd> or <kbd>.so</kbd> files
			(depending on the configuration to build static or shared libraries), and 
			<kbd>programs</kbd> which is a mirror of <kbd>objects/programs</kbd> with
			all <kbd>.o</kbd> files made into their final executable programs. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This system is good enough for me as a sole contributor to my own projects.
			I have no need to learn or use build system generators such as CMake since 
			I primarily use Vim, GCC, Make, and Linux. When I do work on my project 
			from Windows, I use MSYS 2 which provides a decent terminal with ports of 
			all the Linux and GNU utilities I use on Windows. I believe MSYS 2 is also 
			portable on usb flash drives. 
		</p>
		<!--
		<p>
			I have never purchased an Apple product so 
			I do not think about MacOS when programming, this is Ok because 
			Mac users more educated, more cultured, and more affluent than non-Mac 
			users so they can figure out how to port Linux software to Mac very easily.
			They know that Mac is Unix without the bloat of GNU software so it is a 
			superior Unix with a superior License and a superior curated App store made 
			by a responsible and socially-conscious company working to make the world a 
			better place and not for the greed of money like those other companies that 
			overprice their products while depending on unethical labor.
		</p>
		-->
		<p>
			There is a possibility of course, that my projects of libraries and/or 
			native tools shall be ported to run on Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, or Google 
			owned software that is leased to the consumer, in which case I try to 
			avoid compiler or platform specific code. This is not to say that I stick 
			to C89, as this would be the most portable way to program in C, I prefer 
			to use the version of C that is the previous from the current major 
			revision which in this case is C11. I would prefer to use the current 
			major revision (C23), but it is not released yet and it will take a while 
			for adoption by the respectable compiler venders when it does get released.
		</p>
		<p>
			The actual project code should aim to be ABI stable from the start by 
			separating interface from implementation, thus reducing compilation 
			dependencies and compilation time. This means that the use of 
			code-generating polymorphic code is discouraged. Also the use of data 
			types whose structure may change in later versions of the project is 
			forbidden. When polymorphism is needed, it can be provided using 
			function references attached to dynamically-allocated objects; these kinds 
			of objects should not directly expose a mutable reference to any of their 
			internal members even if the object represents a data structure.
		</p>
		<p>
			The names of common operations of an object should be as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>make</code>: Dynamically allocates and initializes an object and 
				returns a reference to it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>fork</code>: Dynamically allocates and copy-initializes an object
				from another existing object. A reference to the copy-initialized object 
				is returned.
			<li>
				<code>kill</code>: Finalizes and deallocates an object.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>type</code>: A static, immutable string representing the type of 
				the object implementing this interface.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>get</code>: Extracts data out of the object.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>put</code>: Inserts data into the object.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>swap</code>: Efficiently performs a <code>get</code> and 
				<code>put</code> at the same time.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Sometimes objects, especially data structures, store elements that 
			themselves need to provide a way for copying, comparison, and destruction. 
			The following operations can be provided for these elements:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>copy</code>: Copy-initialize an already allocated object from 
				another existing object. If this is null, then it is assumed the object
				can be copied using <code>memcpy</code>. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>test</code>: Perform a three-way comparison between two objects.
				This operation is required for data structures that need it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>wipe</code>: Finalize but do not deallocate an object. This 
				operation does not modify the object since it could have been allocated 
				in immutable storage. If this is null, then it is assumed the object is 
				plain-old-data.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			It is with intent that all these operations are no more than 4 characters
			long while not being abbreviated.
		</p>
		<p>
			For my project, it is assumed that all objects can be moved with a 
			<code>memcpy</code> operation. This movement results in the implicit 
			destruction of the original object. This detail is important for the 
			<code>get</code> and <code>put</code> operations which both use 
			<code>memcpy</code> for the insertion or extraction of data on the object.
			In addition to extraction, the <code>get</code> operation should directly 
			destroy data out of an object if the target out-parameter is null. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Often, objects can be constructed from other objects, in which case the 
			constructed object takes ownership over it's components. Destroying the 
			constructed object results in it's components being destroyed first. 
			Objects that implement <code>kill</code> in their interface makes this 
			possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Objects that perform dynamic memory allocation should take an allocator 
			as part of their construction. The allocator can implement the same 
			common interface as outlined above with these semantics:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>fork</code>: Clones or <q>propagates</q> the allocator.</li>
			<li><code>kill</code>: Destroys the allocator</li>
			<li><code>test</code>: Compares two allocators. Zero for equal and non-zero 
			otherwise.</li>
			<li><code>get</code>: Allocate memory from the allocator.</li>
			<li><code>put</code>: Return allocated memory back to the allocator.</li>
			<li><code>swap</code>: Reallocate memory.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If <code>fork</code> is null, then it implies the allocator is stateless 
			and cloning it will always return the same allocator. If <code>kill</code> 
			is null, then the allocator is stateless and has no destruction method. 
			If <code>test</code> is null, then the allocator type is stateless and 
			shall always compare equal to other allocators of the same type. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The common interface also works well for I/O streams:
		</p>
		<ul>	
			<li><code>get</code>: Read from the stream.</li>
			<li><code>put</code>: Write or push-back to the stream.</li>
			<li><code>swap</code>: Read and then push-back to the stream.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For data structures:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>get</code>: Extract an element.</li>
			<li><code>put</code>: Insert an elemet.</li>
			<li><code>swap</code>: Exchange an element.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The above operations shall be the only way a data structure grants 
			element access. A data structure should never allow direct access to an 
			element, even if it is immutable direct access because it is my insight
			that a destructor can be invoked by the user on an immutable element 
			(or they can outright drop the <code>const</code> qualifier from any 
			pointer). The value here is strongly upholding invariants on data 
			structures at the cost of speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other perculiar practices I try to use for myself include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Explicitly stating the storage class of all variables (
			<code>register</code>, <code>extern</code>, <code>static</code>, and 
			<code>auto</code>): Always using <code>register</code> for function 
			parameters but never for other local variables. 
			<li>Expressing pointers and qualifiers using right-to-left syntax and 
			always with explicit parentheses around the declarator.</li>
			<li>Declaring variables on separate lines.</li>
			<li>Avoiding side-effects in subexpressions.</li>
			<li>Avoiding implicit conversions, especially the arithmetic ones.</li>
			<li>Always using braces around blocks even for single-statement blocks.</li>
			<li>Preferring nested if-statements over short-circuiting operators and
			using bitwise operators where short-circuiting is not required.</li>
			<li>Explicitly casting the return value of a function call to 
			<code>void</code> when the return value is not needed.</li>
			<li>Explicitly casting a function parameter/variable to void when that 
			parameter/variable is not needed.</li>
			<li>Preferring to declare variables as <code>const</code> and pointer 
			variables as <code>restrict</code> when possible.</li>
			<li>Placing parameters/arguments of functions/function calls on separate 
			lines if the parameter count is greater than 2.</li>
			<li>Avoiding variable-length arrays</li>
			<li>Avoiding <code>alloca</code></li>
			<li>Avoiding flexible array members</li>
			<li>Avoiding format strings and variadic arguments</li>
			<li>Preferring to dereference function pointers before using them in order 
			to show that an indirect call is being made.</li>
			<li>Always making an expression within a boolean context be 
			the result of a comparison operation.</li>
			<li>Using spaces around all binary operators (including member access 
			operators) and a space after all unary operators unless that unary operator
			precedes an open parenthesis.</li>
			<li>Using the correct suffix for literal expressions.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			There are compiler options that can help with these preferences. After 
			skimming through the entire GCC man page, I made a specific list of GCC 
			options for my Makefile. With these options, I also make all non-standard C
			into warnings and all warnings into errors. I also make the compiler stop 
			after the first error and I turn off unnecessary (for me) diagnostic 
			information (carets, labels, and paths) to keep the terminal 
			uncluttered and speed up compilation.
		</p>
		<p>
			I hope this project structure and organization can help me stay productive 
			and can help me remember where I left off when I take breaks and come back 
			to my code after long periods.
