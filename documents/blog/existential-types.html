		Existential types formalize the program activity of dynamic dispatch 
		implemented through virtual functions. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The most basic existential type is &exist;A.A which represents an unknown 
		type called A. It is possible for a term of this type to exist; strictly speaking, 
		there is no operation that can be performed on such a term since the valid 
		operations for this term are unknown. Loosely speaking, a term of 
		&exist;.A.A can possibly be copied, moved, and/or explicitly destroyed 
		depending on the type system.
	</p>
	<p>
		More generally, the type &exist;A.e where A occurs in e is an 
		<em>incomplete</em> type in the sense that it is a type e expressed in terms 
		of some unknown type A.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the paper <cite>Abstract Types Have Existential Type, by Mitchell and 
		Plotkin</cite>, syntax is introduced for introducing and eliminating 
		existential types with semantics for how they implement abstract data types 
		with dynamic dispatch.
	</p>
	<p>
		The expression (pack Z with x to E), where the term x has a type that 
		depends on Z, introduces a term of existential type E. The language uses E 
		as a guide to type-erase each instance of Z in x while carefully not 
		type-erasing terms whose structure coincidentally matches that of Z while not 
		actually being Z.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a language with strictly nominal type equivalence, the expression can 
		be shortened to simply (pack x to E) and a kind of reverse pattern matching 
		will be performed to strip x of implementation details.
	</p>
	<p>
		An expression like (unpack A with y from e in b) introduces both a new opaque 
		type A and term y whose type depends on A from the existential term e; A and 
		y are bound to the scope of b.
	</p>
	<p>
		When looking into implementation details, especially for a language with 
		manual memory management, it is obvious how an existential term can be 
		implemented with something like an opaque reference to heap storage; but it 
		becomes less obvious as to how such a term can be cleaned up without 
		having a garbage collector.
	</p>
	<p>
		The answer seems to be to combine existential types with a linear type 
		system. An additional expression like (drop e) will be required to free 
		an existential term.

		<h3>An aside on linear types and imperative programming</h3>
		<p>
			Even though linear types have conventionally been 
			described in the context of functional programming which conventionally 
			uses garbage collection, they seem to naturally fit with imperative 
			programming with manual memory management. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Linear types need to reconciled with the existence of memory references 
			and mutable variables present in imperative programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			To do this, the initialization status of every linear variable needs to be 
			tracked by the compiler:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A linear variable cannot be read if it is empty</li>
			<li>A mutable linear variable cannot be assigned if it is not empty</li>
			<li>A linear variable becomes empty after being read</li>
			<li>A mutable linear variable becomes non-empty after being assigned</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			A block cannot access linear variables declared in any outer block. A 
			linear variable can only be directly read/written by the block in 
			which that linear variable is directly declared. Linear values can only be 
			directly transferred across blocks via parameters and results; however, 
			linear values can be indirectly transferred across blocks via linear 
			references.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Non-linear references cannot refer to linear variables
			</li>
			<li>
				A linear reference made to a linear variable freezes the linear variable 
				until the linear reference is eliminated
			</li>
			<li>
				A linear reference must be qualified as a read-only, write-only, or 
				a modify reference.
				<ul>
					<li>
						A read-only linear reference can only be made to a non-empty linear 
						variable. 
					</li>
					<li>
						A write-only linear reference can only be made to an empty linear 
						variable
					</li>
					<li>
						A modify linear reference can only be made on a non-empty linear 
						variable
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				A read-only linear reference is eliminated by indirectly reading 
				through it
			</li>
			<li>
				A write-only linear reference is eliminated by indirectly writing through
				it
			</li>
			<li>
				A modify linear reference can be eliminated in a number of ways:
				<ul>
					<li>By directly eliminating it with no additional action</li>
					<li>By indirectly swapping linear values through it</li>
					<li>
						By a binary operator of the language which takes the modify 
						linear reference and a function from the referenced type to 
						the referenced type. The operator indirectly reads from the 
						reference, sends it to the function, and indirectly writes the 
						result back out through the reference
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Because of the elimination rules for the different kinds of linear 
				references, when a linear variable is unfrozen after the expiration of 
				it's linear reference, the variable's initialization status is expected 
				to be:
			</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Empty if it was unfrozen from the elimination of it's read-only 
				linear reference
				</li>
				<li>
					Non-empty if it was unfrozen from the elimination of it's write-only
					linear reference
				</li>
				<li>
					Non-empty if it was unfrozen from the elimination of it's modify 
					linear reference
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	</aside>
	<p>
		A term made from (pack x to E) shall itself be stack allocated but 
		each occurence of a term of the type to hide in x, which is not inside the 
		body of a function, shall be replaced with an opaque reference to a heap 
		allocated object of the hidden type and each function term in x shall have 
		any occurence of the type to hide changed to an opaque reference within it's 
		parameter and/or result type. The functions that use the hidden type in their 
		body shall internally type cast from the opaque reference back to a reference 
		to the original hidden type when necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an exception, dynamic allocation is not necessary if a term of the 
		hidden type is stored statically; it can be rewritten as an opaque reference 
		to itself directly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's make clear as to what is being stored on the heap with existential 
		terms. The term of type &exist;T.T is the presense of some term of unknown 
		type: there is nothing we know about this term and therefore there is no 
		way to use it. Internally it is stored as a memory reference to some opaque 
		data stored on the heap. While it may be legal to produce a term of this 
		type, there is no way to consume or clean up this term and therefore no 
		source code that produces this term can be compiled under a linear type 
		system.
	</p>
	<p>
		What is slightly more useful is the term 
		(&exist;A.A&#8523;A&#8888;A&#8523;A&#8888;1). It represents some term of 
		unknown type A with a unary operation that transforms it and another 
		unary operation that finalizes it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		&#8523; is used to allow us to manually use each component of the unpacked 
		&exist; term when we're ready. If &bigotimes; was used, then the process 
		would automatically eliminate each component like a chemical reaction as 
		soon as the &exist; term is unpacked which is also useful to have.
	</p>
	<p>
		Let's show how this data algebra can be translated to C++. The C++ class:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="no-margin padded code">#&nbsp;include&lt;cstddef&gt;<br>#&nbsp;include&lt;span&gt;<br>using&nbsp;namespace&nbsp;std;<br><br>template&lt;typename&nbsp;Type&gt;<br>struct&nbsp;Writer{<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;ptrdiff_t&nbsp;write(span&lt;Type&gt;&nbsp;buffer)&nbsp;noexcept&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;~&nbsp;Writer()&nbsp;=&nbsp;default;};<br></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>
		Assuming a normal type system, this class can be a translation from the expression:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="no-margin shaded padded">
			&forall; T . &exist; A . A &wedge; (A &wedge; &Sigma;<sub>n:size_t</sub> T<sup>n</sup> &rarr; ptrdiff_t) &wedge; (A &rarr; 1)
		</pre>
	</figure>
	<p>
		This abstract type is paramatized for any type (but not really, additional type checking with templates should be used to check if Type is movable and destructible.) and provides an interface for sending out an array of that type.
	</p>
	<p>
		The &Sigma; type is a dependent type representing an array of n : size_t 
		bytes. In a linear type system, the write function would consume both the 
		array and A and return both a ptrdiff_t (representing the number of bytes 
		written or a negative value on failure) and a new A; and the destructor would 
		consume A without returning it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In C, the implementation would be:
	</p>
	<figure>
		<pre class="no-margin padded code">#&nbsp;include&lt;stddef.h&gt;<br>#&nbsp;define&nbsp;writer(type)&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;type&nbsp;##&nbsp;_writer<br>#&nbsp;define&nbsp;instantiate_writer(type)&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;typedef&nbsp;struct{&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void(*&nbsp;state);&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ptrdiff_t(&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*&nbsp;write)(&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void(*&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;state)&nbsp;,&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size_t(length)&nbsp;,&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;type(*&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;buffer)));&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void(&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(*&nbsp;close)(&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void(*&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;state)));}&nbsp;\<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;(writer(type));<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></pre>
	</figure>
	<p>
		In C, parametric polymorphism is accomplished with macros but with the 
		disadvantage that instantiation must be performed manually. Dynamic dispatch
		from existential quantification is accomplished using the <code>void *</code>
		type for opaque terms with pointers to functions that accept <code>void *</code>	for manipulating those terms. Unlike this example, the function pointers 
		would, in practice, usually be stored in a separate structure to be 
		referenced by the instantiated writer type so that each instantiated writer 
		instance only stores two pointers. I do not do that here since that would 
		require defining another separate parametized type with a need for additional
		macro definitions to support it, thus complicating the example.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using macros with token concatenation to generate new identifiers is a 
		relatively new application of the preprocessor I have learned to implement 
		universal quantification in C, it relieves me from the necessity of using 
		C++ as I work on the compiler for my new language which is not publically 
		released yet. This combined with <code>void *</code> for type erasure for 
		existential quantification pretty much makes C++ not fundamentally needed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		It may seem senile to insist on using C over C++ in the current year for 
		this project, but this insistence is rooted in the higher portability of 
		the C language over C++ as well as the desire to avoid dealing with 
		hidden control flow and the boilerplate of having to declare and default the 
		many constructors, assignment operators, and swap operations for each 
		type that I define. I am also going to use C as a compilation target so 
		implementing the compiler in C avoids hypocrisy and is also aesthetically 
		pleasing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I also find it disgusting that <code>std::exception</code> uses 
		<em>statically</em> stored strings for error messages with the downside that 
		exceptions use hidden control flow possibly implemented by <em>dynamic</em> 
		allocation when being propagated while <code>std::error_condition</code> 
		uses <em>dynamically</em> stored strings for error messages but is otherwise 
		propagated without dynamic allocation. What I want is non-dynamic allocation 
		during error handling without hidden control flow. The C++ standard library
		is useless and filled with legacy cruft.
	</p>
	<p>
		So much for more language burning tangents, this signals the end of this post.
