			<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
		</header>
		<p>
			I have been opining to myself about how a programming language should 
			define the behavior of arithmetic, especially in regards to integer types 
			of limited precision. The compilation target language of the source 
			language should be considered when making a practical decision. Popular 
			wisdom can also be found in how other languages handle arithmetic but 
			it would not be wise to blindly copy their methods.

			I like to think that C would make a good target language for a new 
			programming language. To stay portable, C makes very few assumptions about
			the it's standard integer types. Here are those types and their minimum
			requirements prior to the new C23 standard:

			Some important definitions from C (definitions of my own extrapolations 
			are unquoted):
		</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Bit</dt>
			<dd>
				<q>unit of data storage in the execution environment large enough to hold
				an object that may have one of two values</q>
			</dd>
			<dt>Byte</dt>
			<dd>
				<q>addressable unit of data storage larage enough to hold any member of 
				the basic character set of the execution environment</q>
			</dd>
			<dt>Object</dt>
			<dd>
				<q>region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of 
				which can represent values</q>
			</dd>
			<dt>Precision</dt>
			<dd>
				(of an integer type) <q>the number of bits it uses to represent values,
				excluding any sign and padding bits</q>
			</dd>
			<dt>Size</dt>
			<dd>
				the number of bytes an object or any object of a specified complete type 
				occupy in data storage
			</dd>
			<dt>Value</dt>
			<dd>
				<q>precise meaning of the contents of an object when interpreted as 
				having a specific type</q>
			</dd>
			<dt>Width</dt>
			<dd>
				(of an integer type) the same as the precision except that the sign bit 
				is also included
			</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>
			The size is the width plus the padding bit count, the width is the 
			precision if there is no sign bit or precision + 1 otherwise, and the 
			precision is the count of value bits excluding the sign bit.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is not necessarily true that the bit size is always equal to the bit 
			width for all integer types. Even though the standard repeatedly says 
			that integer padding bits are unnecessary, it also says that 
			implementations may include them for trap representations generated from 
			overflows and division by zero.
		</p>
		<p>
			As an exception, the standard does not grant the possibility of padding 
			bits to <code>signed char</code> and <code>unsigned char</code>; this
			exception also extends to <code>char</code> which, as a type distinct 
			from either, has the same structure as one or the other.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pre-C23 standards permit 3 possible value representations for 
			signed integers:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>sign and magnitude</em></li>
			<li><em>two's complement</em></li>
			<li><em>one's complement</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Both <em>sign and magnitude</em> and <em>one's complement</em> support
			the negative zero value for all signed integers. Two's complement does 
			not support negative zero but it does extend each signed integer's
			minimum value by one. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When not in two's complement, it is undefined behavior to overflow with 
			addition, subtraction, or multiplication; otherwise, the behavior is 
			defined to wrap around: this is why two's complement became the industry
			standard and eventually became mandatory in the C23 standard.
		</p>
		<p>
			Regardless of the signed integer representation, undefined behavior in
			arithmetic occurs in:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Division by zero</li>
			<li>Remainder by zero</li>
			<li>Bitwise left/right shift with a negative right-operand</li>
			<li>Bitwise left/right shift overflow with a signed, nonnegative left-operand</li>
			<li>
				Bitwise left/right shift with a right operand that is <q>greater than or equal to 
				the width of the promoted left operand
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Additionally, bitwise right shift with a negative left-operand is 
			implementation-defined behavior.

			<h3>3. Desired Arithmetic Behavior</h3>
		</header>
		<p>
			I desire a language that does not produce undefined behavior (UB) or 
			implementation-defined behavior (IB) in it's programs, so I dislike any 
			language that copies C's arithmetic. Indeed it is better for the 
			well-defined behavior of aborting the program on an arithmetic exception 
			than it is to continue running with absurd results or results that vary 
			with the current execution environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe some language authors have considered the run-time performance 
			cost or compile-time static analysis cost of correctness to not be worth 
			the benefit of eliminating UB from arithmetic. When I finish my language,
			I will have to empirically weigh this cost too.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the late standardization, it is a step in the right direction for 
			C23 to reduce UB and IB by mandating two's complement; silent 
			wraparound due to overflow, however, is often unanticipated by the 
			programmer. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the ways to deal with overflows:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Abort</li>
			<li>Throw an exception</li>
			<li>Saturate</li>
			<li>Wrap around</li>
			<li>Return unit</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			Aborting the program or throwing an exception on overflow are not the 
			best solutions because they both render the arithmetic operation as 
			possibly divergent because control flow does not necessarily resume from 
			where the operation was initiated: making total functions impossible to
			write. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Saturating arithmetic and modular (wrap around) arithmetic have their 
			applications but the programmer should not be forced to have one or the 
			other as the only option. I appreciate how the Zig language has 3 versions 
			of each operator where overflow is possible: one that aborts, one that 
			wraps around, and one that saturates.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have not seen a language where the arithmetic operators return an 
			optional result (a sum between the resulting value and the unit value). 
			Option/result types are great for propagating errors or the indication of 
			the uncomputability of an operation. Because these are sum types, they 
			must be pattern matched to be eliminated and so things like possible 
			overflows cannot be forgotten or ignored by the programmer.
		</p>
		<p>
			For any possibly overflowing binary operator f, terms x and y of the same 
			integer type T, and term z of type T | (): the expressions: x f y, x f z,
			z f y, and z f z each have a resulting type T | (). If x f y fails, it 
			returns (). If z matches (), the operation immediately returns (); 
			otherwise, the computation is attempted and () is returned only on 
			failure. This ensures that () does not need to be tediously checked after 
			each operation because () will always be propagated through the 
			composition to the surface.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arithmetic operators that propagate unit which must be checked for by 
			the end of their composition can be the recommended operators for 
			arithmetic with specialized versions of these operators for performing 
			saturation or wrap around on overflow available as well: this is what my
			language will provide. I prefer to avoid possible divergence unless 
			absolutely necessary (such as when performing a system call or calling 
			foreign code), so I would not include aborting or stack unwinding in 
			an arithmetic operator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Proper attention must be paid to the C standard when implementing these 
			operators. Sometimes what is said in the standard does not match the 
			behavior of any implementation so prudence should be used when deciding 
			to depend or not depend on a specific behavior for which the standard 
			and the compiler vendors do not have a consensus with. And no matter what
			is both standardized and implemented by the majority of implementations, 
			there will always be a few things that Microsoft will do uniquely, not 
			that I care.
