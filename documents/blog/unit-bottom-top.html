<p>My notes for what unit types and bottom types are and how they should work 
in a proper programming languages.</p>
<p>Important definitions:</p>
<ol>
	<li>&forall; &sigma; . &sigma; &rarr; ()</li>
	<li>&forall; &sigma; . &bot; &rarr; &sigma;</li>
</ol>
<p>Definition 1 says any type &sigma; can be converted to the unit type ().
It is a morphism from any object to the terminal object in category theory, 
ergo () is the terminal object.</p>
<p>Definition 2 says the bottom type &bot; can be converted into any type 
&sigma;. It is a morphism from the initial object to any object in 
category theory, ergo &bot; is the initial object.</p>
<p>If information is defined as an observable entity with 2 or more possible 
states, then a unit type, which is the type of entities with 1 possible state,
is not a type of information.</p>
<p>The unit type is the empty product, which can be specified as the parameter
or result of a function which denotes a function that can be applied with no
argument or a function that yields no value when applied, respectively.</p>
<p>Definition 1, the conversion from any type to (), works by taking 
any term and discarding it which yields the absence of information in the 
form of a term of the unit type. Besides always being convertible from any 
other term, the unit type can always be introduced on it's own. Because () is 
not a type of information, no term with this type can be referenced or 
mutated.</p>
<p>Before explaining how definition 2 works, let's first acknowledge that 
&bot; is being used primarily as the result type of a function that never 
terminates. These kinds of functions, belonging to &forall; &sigma; . &sigma; 
&rarr; &bot;, can be implemented in a programming language by issuing a trap, 
which usually indefinitely returns control to the host environment. &bot; can 
also be implemented by infinite recursion.</p>
<p>After entering a trap, the host environment may resume execution of the 
program rather than terminating it, this can be the case for host environments
that are debuggers; in this case, the host may send information to the program
when it resumes, which becomes the result of the trap instruction.</p>
<p>The result produced from a trap becomes the result of evaluating &bot; if 
it's evaluation does indeed converge; therefore &bot; can be converted to 
any type as the host may return a term of any type.</p>
<p>Whereas () is the type of terms with 1 possible state, &bot; is said to be 
the type of terms that lack any state. A more succinct definition for &bot; 
in our case would be the type whose terms have no definite range of state: 
the type of unknown state. But this definition seems to be more appropriate 
for the top type &top;: the type that is said to contain all states of all 
other types.</p>
<p>The top type can be introduced for those trap operations that converge 
and return anything while the bottom type can be refined to only those 
operations that diverge.</p>
<p>The new definitions are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>&rarr; ()</li>
	<li>&forall; &sigma; . &sigma; &harr; ()</li>
	<li>&bot; &rarr;</li>
	<li>&forall; &sigma; . &top; &harr; &sigma;</li>
	<li>&forall; &sigma; . ref &top; &harr; ref &sigma;</li>
</ul>
<p>Terms such as <code>abort</code> or <code>panic</code> which may be 
defined as functions returning &bot; can be used to introduce &bot; and to
signify the immediate termination (or non-termination) of a program.</p>
<p>&top; can be introduced with a function like <code>system</code> which 
performs something like a system call and will return anything. Notice the 
new 4th and 5th definitions where the conversion is bi-directional. This 
decision allows for any type to be converted to any other type by performing 
an intermediary conversion to &top;, this applies to references as well, thus 
effectively allowing a way for one to bypass the type system if needed.</p>
<p>Notice also that I modified the unit type to be bi-directionally convertible
on any type. This is more of an optional feature. Converting from () to some 
type &sigma; involves creating a term of type &sigma; with a default value;
this value could be the value derived from setting all it's value bits to
zero. This imposes a requirement on all types (except &bot; and &top;) 
that they support a default zero value. If this rule is used, then one can 
say that all these types are movable by copying and clearing their bits.</p>
<h3>Addendum</h3>
<time datetime="2022-09-09">2022-09-09</time>
<p>Not all system calls are guaranteed to return if the operation of the system 
call depends on a run-time argument. A general-purpose language that 
allows system calls cannot have a separate procedure for each specific system 
call operation as this collection is platform dependent. A general-purpose 
language will provide one procedure for performing system calls that will be
polymorphic on the parameter and result types. The actual type of the 
<code>system</code> function should be &forall;&sigma; . &sigma; &rarr; &top; +
&bot;. Alternatively, it could be: &top; &rarr; &top; + &bot;. The system call
can take any type of argument and it can return any type of result if the 
system call does indeed converge.</p>
<p>In source code of a strongly-typed language that compiles to modules whose 
exported procedures cannot have polymorphic types, the <code>system</code> 
procedure would be an exceptional procedure that is generic unless the 
language supports user-defined generic procedures. For the language to support 
generic procedures without run-time overhead, separate versions of that 
procedure need to be generated for each concrete type it can take on when it 
is called. When exporting a generic procedure, there must be a separate name 
for each instatiation of it's polymorphic type, then name mangling 
becomes a problem.</p>
<p>I believe a more general solution would be to support macros that can 
generate procedures but that must be manually expanded by the user for each 
procedure type they plan on using. The <code>system</code> procedure would 
be a special built-in procedure, the only one allowing &top; as a parameter 
type.</p>
<p>When eliminating a term &sigma; of type &top; + &bot; it seems quite absurd
to match &sigma; on &bot; and return &sigma;. Such a routine becomes a 
formality that never gets executed and can be eliminated by the compiler; it
is still nontheless valuable to enforce that &bot; gets propagated up the 
call chain to show that any procedure that may return &bot; affects the 
result of type of all other procedures that may call it. The language must 
be designed to not allow &bot; to be dropped once it's introduced for
this to work.</p>
