		<h3>Introduction</h3>

				ownership semantics
			</a>
		</em> all attempt to address the problem of mutable data aliasing at the 
		language level. These are popular languages with devoted users, many of 
		whom heavily appreciate each language's approach to handling aliasing.
	</p>
	<p>
		C++'s 
		<code><a
			rel="external noreferrer noopener"
			href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr">unique_ptr</a></code>,
		a library feature that is based on move semantics, is used like a 
		reference and prohibits itself from being copied: thus it eliminates 
		aliasing of the referenced data. This abstraction can be bypassed 
		by using the 
		<code><a
			rel="external noreferrer noopener"
			href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/get">get</a></code>
		member function of a unique_ptr which reveals the underlying 
		managed pointer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rust's ownership semantics rejects all programs where 2 or more usable 
		references, with mutable access to the same mutable data region, can exist.
		Ownership semantics can be bypassed within Rust code that is marked as 
		<code><a
			rel="external noreferrer noopener"
			href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-01-unsafe-rust.html">unsafe</a></code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		C's restrict semantics does not disallow mutable data aliasing, but it 
		restricts it in a structured way which helps the compiler's analysis for 
		optimization opportunities. Specifically, a restricted pointer,
		existing as an initialized variable and while it has not gone out of scope, 
		only allows access to it's referred object through an expression that 
		involves reading that restricted pointer variable. The rules of copying 
		restricted pointers are:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			A restricted pointer can be copied to a non-restricted pointer that 
			is declared in either the same block or in an inner block.
		</li>
		<li>
			A restricted pointer can be copied to a restricted pointer that 
			is declared in an inner block.
		</li>
		<li>
			A restricted pointer can be returned from a function and copied to a 
			restricted pointer stored in the callee's block.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		From these rules, one can extrapolate that 2 or more restricted pointers 
		declared in the same block shall never refer to overlapping regions of 
		memory. This derived rule is the motivator for their most popular use as
		function parameters.
	</p>

<section id="handles">
	<header>
		<h3>Handles</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		Some see the C++ and Rust approach, which are related to 
		<a href="#!/documents/blog/linear-logic.html">Linear Logic</a>, as 
		overly restrictive and have advocated using <em>handles</em> as an 
		alternative.
	</p>
	<p>
		In an article by Andre Weissflog titled <cite><a 
		rel="external noreferrer noopener"
		href="https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html">
		Handles are the better pointers</a></cite>, he proposes a programming 
		style where you essentially write your own modules that handle the 
		allocation of specific classes of objects that permit access to themselves
		indirectly through a handle where only the module knows how to 
		convert that handle back into a raw pointer.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a fine idea, but it breaks down as soon as a bypass is introduced
		just like in the other approaches. And I quote from that article:
	</p>
	<blockquote class="accented shaded padded">
		<p>
			If user code needs to access the memory of an item directly it needs to obtain a pointer through a ‘lookup function’ which takes a handle as input and returns a pointer. As soon as such a lookup function exists, <mark>the fairly watertight memory safety scenario outlined above is no longer guaranteed, and the user code should adhere to a few rules</mark>:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>pointers should never be stored anywhere, since the next time the pointer is used it may no longer point to the same item, or even to valid memory</li>
			<li>a pointer should only be used in a simple code block, and not ‘across’ function calls</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Every time a handle is converted into a pointer, the system can guarantee that the returned pointer still points to the same item that the handle was originally created for (more on this below), but this guarantee ‘decays’ over time since the item under the pointer may have been destroyed, or the underlying memory may have been reallocated to a different location (this is the same problem as iterator invalidation in C++).</p>

<section id="escape-hatches">
	<header>
		<h3>Escape Hatches</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		All these approaches have in common that they do not fundamentally 
		gaurantee anything because they all allow an <em><a 
		rel="external noreferrer noopener" href="https://wiki.c2.com/?EscapeHatch">
		escape hatch</a></em> from the normal rules or abstraction.
	</p>
	<p>
		Escape hatches are often praised as being necessary but their use 
		destroys any proof of invariants that an abstraction has previously upheld. 
		Everything that the user does within an escape hatch is a black box to
		the surrounding abstraction and it is only based on faith in the user's 
		competence and good intent that he will restore the abstraction's 
		invariants before the escape hatch closes.
	</p>
	<p>
		An algorithm cannot be a program as a proof if it allows arbitrary escape 
		hatches whose effects are localized only based on an honor system, 
		otherwise the entire program can just be regarded as one big instance 
		of the &bot; type because of the infectious nature of escape hatches to
		potentially undo all the propositions that were previously established 
		by the algorithm.
	</p>
	<p>
		When an abstraction is packaged, it's state and it's operations form the 
		seed of a consistent historical tree of valid possibilities. It is 
		important that an abstraction does not become unpackaged, otherwise 
		every operation provided by that abstraction can only assume garbage 
		state corrupted by some escape hatch.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is a fallacy to have <q>safe code that depends on unsafe code</q>, 
		the latter subsumes the former and it just becomes unsafe code. period.
		What is valid is to have unsafe code that depends on safe code: the 
		safe code being an unaffected, separate component.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rather than having escape hatches at all, I think a good programming 
		language will separate safe from unsafe code and not allow the former 
		to depend on the latter. This means that all programs with unsafe 
		components should always have the unsafe parts at the outer layer 
		which executes the safe parts in the inner layer. If any interaction 
		with the outside world is considered to be a subset of unsafe code, then
		all programs should essentially become monads: having an unsafe, 
		imperative shell with a safe, functional core.

		<h3>Linearity</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		In regards to memory safety, using 
		<a 
			rel="external noreferrer noopener" 
			href="https://wiki.c2.com/?LinearTypes">
			linear types
		</a> seems to be a good basis. There seems to be confusion regarding 
		how they may actually work in a programming language but I have some 
		understanding.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, linearity does not apply to the type, instead it applies to the 
		variable: So it is more clear to say <q>linear variable</q>. Second,
		there must be a clear definition as to what constitutes the <em>use</em>
		of a linear variable before deciding that they can only each be used once.
	</p>
	<p>
		To maintain the property that a linear variable has exclusive access to
		it's data, any operation that enables access to it's data should 
		constitute a use of that linear variable; these operations are: 
		directly reading that linear variable's value and obtaining a reference
		to that linear variable's value.
	</p>
	<p>
		For a functional language that does not allow variable reassignment, a 
		linear variable essentially dies after being used. The value or 
		reference obtained from it can then be stored to another linear variable
		or consumed by an operation.
	</p>
	<p>
		For an imperative language that <b>does</b> allow variable reassignment,
		the language must keep track of whether or not a linear variable holds a
		value. A linear variable should only be allowed to be reassigned after 
		being used; after reassignment, a linear variable becomes unused again.
	</p>
	<p>
		The imperative approach allows the names of linear variables to be reused
		after their values have been consumed. This can also happen as an 
		underlying optimization in the functional approach. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A linear variable is only one-half of the problem of data aliasing. While
		it is clear that 2 copies of the same value cannot be read out of a linear 
		variable, nothing prevents 2 linear variables from being initialized with
		the same value that was obtained from a non-linear, normal variable.
	</p>
	<p>
		A short-sighted solution is to prevent assignment from normal variables 
		to linear variables, but one can bypass this restriction by converting 
		the lvalue from the normal variable into an rvalue by performing an 
		identity operation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A solution would be to introduce proper linear types. A linear type is a 
		type whose terms can only be produced from any of the following: 
		reading a linear variable, obtaining the reference to a linear variable,
		evaluating a linear operation, applying a linear function, and evaluating 
		a linear constant. Linear terms, which are terms of linear types, would 
		not be allowed to be stored into non-linear variables or used within 
		non-linear operations. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Linear terms should be explicitly convertible to their equivalent 
		non-linear terms so that they can be used with the non-linear parts of a 
		language, but this conversion should not be reversible.
	</p>
	<p>
		This ability for non-linear terms to depend on linear terms through a
		conversion is an example of unsafe code depending on safe code. But 
		to maintain that safe code does not depend on unsafe code, it must be 
		illegal to convert from a non-linear term to a linear one.

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		Memory safe abstractions only work if they do not expose implementation 
		details or provide escape hatches. The presence of either disproves the 
		abstraction and invalidates any invariants. Once safety has been dropped 
		out, recovery is impossible to prove. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A language should not allow safe code to depend on unsafe code through
		the presence and use of escape hatches; rather, safe code should 
		only be allowed to depend safe code while unsafe code can depend on 
		both.
	</p>
	<p>
		This notion should extend to the type system where unsafe types can be
		obtained as a conversion from a safe type but safe types cannot be 
		obtained as a conversion from an unsafe type. The unsafe types are the 
		non-linear types and the safe types are the linear ones.
