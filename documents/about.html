				<h3>About Mark Swoope</h3>
			</header>
			<p>
				Programming and computer science has been my passion since 2008. I love 
				learning how software works from a concise and fundamental level by 
				building them from scratch. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have recently taken an interest in compilers, functional programming, 
				type theory, and linear logic. I am currently creating a 
				general-purpose programming language that I will release soon.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am open for hire or recruitment, please contact me by
				<a href="mailto:markswoope@outlook.com">email</a>.
